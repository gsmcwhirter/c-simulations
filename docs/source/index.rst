Documentation for the c-simulations Framework
=============================================

This is a framework for running two types of game theory simulations
in C. It can run n-population replicator dynamics simulations or
Herrnstein-Roth-Erev urn learning simulations.

It builds both static and shared versions of two libraries that should
be linked to the program that actually runs the simulations.
