# c-simulations

This is a library providing a framework for running discrete time
replicator dynamics simulations in C.

## API

Please see the tests/all_tests.c file and the headers for examples of 
everything in the API.

In general, the Makefile builds both a static and a shared library that
can be used in the usual ways one might use such things.

## Python Integration

I will also be working on a bridge to python. Keep an eye out if you're
interested in such a thing.
